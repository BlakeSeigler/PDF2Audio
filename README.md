# PDF2Audio
This project will be software to turn PDFs of text into audio recordings. My primary use case for this project is to take books with PDFs online and turn them into audiobooks.

To Do:
- Use llama or similar llm to filter out the content and provide options for book or research paper
- Build out a UI for use
- Package it using pyinstaller and upload to github with instructions

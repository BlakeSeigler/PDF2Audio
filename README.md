# PDF2Audio
This project will be software to turn PDFs of text into audio recordings. My primary use case for this project is to take books with PDFs online and turn them into audiobooks.

This branch of the project uses an API token to connect to models on hugging face for LLM based filtering of the text in the PDFs.

This method ultimately fails because it runs out of free credits way too fast. At this stage in my life, the probability of me dropping the required capital to front the infrastructure necessary to run this current software architecture is doubtful i.e. I ain't paying that bill :(

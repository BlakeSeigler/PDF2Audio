## PDF2Audio
This project will be software to turn PDFs of text into audio recordings. My primary use case for this project is to take books with PDFs online and turn them into audiobooks.

This is the main branch source code. This code is complete and can be downloaded and run as the hosted website. However, the filtering is very primitive. That being said, there are other branches in which the filtering has been upgraded using LLMs. These LLMs will be setup in different ways in order to provide a learning opportunity.


# For the project experience

Please view the branch "filter-local-ml-model". Here I fully worked out a more sophisticated (although far from perfect) filtering system. See the readme for info on how to use that version. I will not be providing much more detail on this branch so I highly reccomend checking that one out.

# To Use

For whatever reason you want to use this branch instead of the other you can do the following. Clone this branch or copy the files, enter the /website directory, download the requirements, run your enviroment, and run "flask run". If you have any questions feel free to contact me although I may not get back to you.

# PDF2Audio
This project will be software to turn PDFs of text into audio recordings. My primary use case for this project is to take books with PDFs online and turn them into audiobooks.

This is the main branch source code. This code is complete and can be downloaded and run as the hosted website. However, the filtering is very primitive. That being said, there are other branches in which the filtering has been upgraded using LLMs. These LLMs will be setup in different ways in order to provide a learning opportunity.

# PDF2Audio
This project will be software to turn PDFs of text into audio recordings. My primary use case for this project is to take books with PDFs online and turn them into audiobooks.

To Do:
- Modify text filtering
- Add other audio file types to save as
- Build out a small backend and frontend UI to host this on the web
